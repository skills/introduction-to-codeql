## Finish

_Congratulations! You have completed this course!_ üèÜ

Here's a recap of all the tasks you accomplished in your repository:
  - Enabled CodeQL on your repository.
  - CodeQL scanned the code in your repository and notified us of two SQL injection vulnerabilities.
  - Reviewed the findings, marked the findings as closed, and explored the audit trail.
  - Fixed your code in the main branch and saw that the findings automatically closed out.
  - Introduced a new vulnerability in a new branch.
  - Created a pull request, and were notified of the vulnerability.

### What's next?

- Continue your learning! Our [code scanning documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning) is a great resource for learning more about CodeQL.
- Learn more about CodeQL. Take a look at the [CodeQL documenation](https://codeql.github.com/docs/) site to learn about all of the features of this powerful tool.
